# AMATH 563: Inferring Structure of Complex System

This repository contains the project write up for AMATH 563 which covers the fundamental concepts of network science and graph thoery for analyzing complex dynamical systems.

### Projects
1. Discovering governing equations from data using sparse regression and information theory
2. Predicting dynamical system evolution using neural network
3. Large-scale multi-resolution spatial-temporal decomposition of El Nino and La Nina phenomena
4. Network analysis of C.elegans neural networks with Kuramoto oscillators
